Theme Suggestions
=================

Originally, Parrot was based on and required Mothership to function. Upon extracting out the base theme, it was found
that there were some gaps in the template files. The templates in this folder have been brought over from mothership
and can be used as bases for any specific templates your theme might need. All you need to do is copy these
suggestion files into the templates folder found in the root of the theme and you are off to the races.
